# Chapter 3. Anatomy of an eBPF Program

In the previous chapter you saw a simple eBPF “Hello World” program written using the BCC framework. In this chapter there’s an example version of a “Hello World” program written entirely in C so that you can see some of the details BCC took care of behind the scenes.

This chapter also shows you the stages an eBPF program goes through on its journey from source code to execution, as illustrated in [Figure 3-1](#c_left_parenthesisor_rustright_parenthe).

![C (or Rust) source code is compiled into eBPF bytecode, which is either JIT-compiled or interpreted into native machine code instructions](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/lebp_0301.png)

###### Figure 3-1. C (or Rust) source code is compiled into eBPF bytecode, which is either JIT-compiled or interpreted into native machine code instructions

An eBPF program is a set of eBPF bytecode instructions. It’s possible to write eBPF code directly in this bytecode, much as it’s possible to program in assembly language. Humans typically find a higher-level programming language easier to deal with, and at least at the time of this writing, I’d say the vast majority of eBPF code is written in C[1](ch03.html#ch03fn1) and then compiled to eBPF bytecode.

Conceptually, this bytecode runs in an eBPF virtual machine within the kernel.

# The eBPF Virtual Machine

The eBPF virtual machine, like any virtual machine, is a software implementation of a computer. It takes in a program in the form of eBPF bytecode instructions, and these have to be converted to native machine instructions that run on the CPU.

In early implementations of eBPF, the bytecode instructions were interpreted within the kernel—that is, every time an eBPF program runs, the kernel examines the instructions and converts them into machine code, which it then executes. Interpreting has since been largely replaced by JIT (just-in-time) compilation for performance reasons and to avoid the possibility of some Spectre-related vulnerabilities in the eBPF interpreter. *Compilation* means the conversion to native machine instructions happens just once, when the program is loaded into the kernel.

eBPF bytecode consists of a set of instructions, and those instructions act on (virtual) eBPF registers. The eBPF instruction set and register model were designed to map neatly to common CPU architectures so that the step of compiling or interpreting from bytecode to machine code is reasonably straightforward.

## eBPF Registers

The eBPF virtual machine uses 10 general-purpose registers, numbered 0 to 9. Additionally, Register 10 is used as a stack frame pointer (and can only be read, but not written). As a BPF program is executed, values get stored in these registers to keep track of state.

It’s important to understand that these eBPF registers in the eBPF virtual machine are implemented in software. You can see them enumerated from `BPF_REG_0` to `BPF_REG_10` in the [*include/uapi/linux/bpf.h* header file](https://oreil.ly/_ZhU2) of the Linux kernel’s source code.

The context argument to an eBPF program is loaded into Register 1 before its execution begins. The return value from the function is stored in Register 0.

Before calling a function from eBPF code, the arguments to that function are placed in Register 1 through Register 5 (not all the registers are used if there are fewer than five arguments).

## eBPF Instructions

The same [*linux/bpf.h* header file](https://oreil.ly/_ZhU2) defines a structure called `bpf_insn`, which represents a BPF instruction:

```
struct bpf_insn {
    __u8 code;          /* opcode */                       
    __u8 dst_reg:4;     /* dest register */               
    __u8 src_reg:4;     /* source register */
    __s16 off;       /* signed offset */                  
    __s32 imm;       /* signed immediate constant */
};
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

Each instruction has an opcode, which defines what operation the instruction is to perform: for example, adding a value to the contents of a register, or jumping to a different instruction in the program.2 The Iovisor project’s “Unofficial eBPF spec” has a list of the valid instructions. ![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

Different operations might involve up to two registers.![3](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/3.png)

Depending on the operation, there might be an offset value and/or an “immediate” integer value.This `bpf_insn` structure is 64 bits (or 8 bytes) long. However, sometimes an instruction might need to span more than 8 bytes. If you want to set a register to a 64-bit value, you can’t somehow squeeze all 64 bits of that value into the structure, along with the opcode and register information. In these cases, the instruction uses *wide instruction encoding* that is 16 bytes long in total. You’ll see an example of this in this chapter.

When loaded into the kernel, the bytecode of an eBPF program is represented by a series of these `bpf_insn` structures. The verifier performs several checks on this information to ensure that the code is safe to run. You’ll learn more about the verification process in [Chapter 6](ch06.html#the_ebpf_verifier).

Most of the different opcodes fall into the following categories:

- Loading a value into a register (either an immediate value or a value read from memory or from another register)
- Storing a value from a register into memory
- Performing arithmetic operations such as adding a value to the contents of a register
- Jumping to a different instruction if a particular condition is satisfied

###### Note

For an overview of eBPF architecture, I recommend the [BPF and XDP Reference Guide](https://oreil.ly/rvm1i) that’s included as part of the Cilium project’s documentation. If you’d like more details, the [kernel documentation](https://oreil.ly/_2XDT) describes the eBPF instructions and encoding quite clearly.

Let’s use another simple example of an eBPF program and follow its journey from C source code, through eBPF bytecode, to machine code instructions.

###### Note

If you want to build and run this code yourself, you’ll find the code along with instructions for setting up an environment to do so at [*github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf*](https://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf). The code for this chapter is in the *chapter3* directory.

The examples in this chapter are written in C using a library called *libbpf*. You’ll learn more about this library in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#co_recomma_btfcomma_and_libbpf).

# eBPF “Hello World” for a Network Interface

The examples in the previous chapter emitted the trace “Hello World” triggered by a system call kprobe; this time I’m going to show an eBPF program that writes a line of trace when triggered by the arrival of a network packet.

Packet processing is a very common application of eBPF. I’ll cover this in a lot more detail in [Chapter 8](ch08.html#ebpf_for_networking), but for now it might be helpful to be aware of the basic idea of an eBPF program that is triggered for every packet of data that arrives on a network interface. The program can inspect and even modify the contents of that packet, and it makes a decision (or *verdict*) on what the kernel should do with that packet. The verdict could tell the kernel to carry on processing it as usual, drop it, or redirect it elsewhere.

In the simple example I’m showing here, the program doesn’t do anything with the network packet; it simply writes out the words *Hello World* and a counter to the trace pipe every time a network packet is received.

The example program is in *chapter3/hello.bpf.c*. It’s a fairly common convention to put eBPF programs into filenames ending with *bpf.c* to distinguish them from user space C code that might live in the same source code directory. Here’s the entire program:

```
#include <linux/bpf.h>                           
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>

int counter = 0;                                 

SEC("xdp")                                       
int hello(void *ctx) {                           
    bpf_printk("Hello World %d", counter);
    counter++;
    return XDP_PASS;
}

char LICENSE[] SEC("license") = "Dual BSD/GPL";  
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

This example starts by including some header files. Just in case you’re not familiar with C coding, every program has to include the header files that define any structures or functions the program is going to use. You can guess from the names that these header files are related to BPF.![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

This example shows how eBPF programs can use global variables. This counter will get incremented every time the program runs.![3](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/3.png)

The macro SEC() defines a section called xdp that you’ll be able to see in the compiled object file. I’ll come back to how the section name is used in Chapter 5, but for now you can simply think of it as defining that it’s an eXpress Data Path (XDP) type of eBPF program.![4](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/4.png)

Here you can see the actual eBPF program. In eBPF, the program name is the function name, so this program is called hello. It uses a helper function, bpf_printk, to write a string of text, increments the global variable counter, and then returns the value XDP_PASS. This is the verdict indicating to the kernel that it should process this network packet as normal.![5](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/5.png)

Finally there is another SEC() macro that defines a license string, and this is a crucial requirement for eBPF programs. Some of the BPF helper functions in the kernel are defined as “GPL only.” If you want to use any of these functions, your BPF code has to be declared as having a GPL-compatible license. The verifier (which we will discuss in Chapter 6) will object if the declared license is not compatible with the functions a program uses. Certain eBPF program types, including those that use BPF LSM (which you’ll learn about in Chapter 9), are also required to be GPL compatible.
###### Note

You might be wondering why the previous chapter used `bpf_trace_printk()` and this version uses `bpf_printk()`. The short answer is that BCC’s version is called `bpf_trace_printk()` and *libbpf*’s version is `bpf_printk()`, but both of those are wrappers around the kernel function `bpf_trace_printk()`. Andrii Nakryiko wrote a [good post](https://oreil.ly/9mNSY) on this on his blog.

This is an example of an eBPF program that attaches to the XDP hook point on a network interface. You can think of the XDP event being triggered the moment a network packet arrives inbound on a (physical or virtual) network interface.

###### Note

Some network cards support offloading XDP programs so that they can be executed on the network card itself. This means each network packet that arrives can be processed on the card, before it gets anywhere near the machine’s CPU. XDP programs can inspect and even modify each network packet, so this is very useful for doing things like DDoS protection, firewalling, or load balancing in a highly performant way. You’ll learn more about this in [Chapter 8](ch08.html#ebpf_for_networking).

You have seen the C source code, so the next step is to compile it into an object the kernel can understand.

# Compiling an eBPF Object File

Our eBPF source code needs to be compiled into the machine instructions that the eBPF virtual machine can understand: eBPF bytecode. The Clang compiler from the [LLVM project](https://llvm.org) will do this if you specify `-target bpf`. The following is an extract from a Makefile that will do the compilation:

```
hello.bpf.o: %.o: %.c
   clang \
       -target bpf \
       -I/usr/include/$(shell uname -m)-linux-gnu \
       -g \
       -O2 -c $< -o $@
```

This generates an object file called *hello.bpf.o* from the source code in *hello.bpf.c*. The `-g` flag is optional here,[3](ch03.html#ch03fn3) but it generates debug information so that you can see the source code alongside the bytecode when you inspect the object file. Let’s inspect this object file to better understand the eBPF code it contains.

# Inspecting an eBPF Object File

The file utility is commonly used to determine the contents of a file:

```
$ file hello.bpf.o
hello.bpf.o: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, eBPF, version 1 (SYSV), with debug_info,
not stripped
```

This shows it’s an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file, containing eBPF code, for a 64-bit platform with LSB (least significant bit) architecture. It includes debug information if you used the `-g` flag at the compilation step.

You can inspect this object further with `llvm-objdump` to see the eBPF instructions:

```
$ llvm-objdump -S hello.bpf.o
```

Even if you’re not familiar with disassembly, the output from this command isn’t too hard to understand:

```
hello.bpf.o:    file format elf64-bpf               

Disassembly of section xdp:                         

0000000000000000 <hello>:                           
;  bpf_printk("Hello World %d", counter");           
    0:   18 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 r6 = 0 ll
    2:   61 63 00 00 00 00 00 00 r3 = *(u32 *)(r6 + 0)
    3:   18 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 r1 = 0 ll
    5:   b7 02 00 00 0f 00 00 00 r2 = 15
    6:   85 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 call 6
;  counter++;                                       
    7:   61 61 00 00 00 00 00 00 r1 = *(u32 *)(r6 + 0)
    8:   07 01 00 00 01 00 00 00 r1 += 1
    9:   63 16 00 00 00 00 00 00 *(u32 *)(r6 + 0) = r1
;  return XDP_PASS;                                 
   10:   b7 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 r0 = 2
   11:   95 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 exit
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

The first line gives further confirmation that hello.bpf.o is a 64-bit ELF file with eBPF code (there’s no particular rhyme or reason why some tools use the term BPF and others eBPF; as I said earlier, these terms are now practically interchangeable).![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

Next comes the disassembly of the section labeled xdp, which matches the SEC() definition in the C source code.![3](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/3.png)

This section is a function called hello.![4](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/4.png)

There are five lines of eBPF bytecode instructions that correspond to the source line bpf_printk("Hello World %d", counter");.![5](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/5.png)

Three lines of eBPF bytecode instructions increment the counter variable.![6](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/6.png)

And another two lines of bytecode are generated from the source code return XDP_PASS;.Unless you’re particularly keen to do so, there’s no real need to understand exactly how each line of bytecode relates to the source. The compiler takes care of generating the bytecode so that you don’t have to think about it! But let’s examine the output in a little more detail so you can get a feel for how this output relates to the eBPF instructions and registers you learned about earlier in this chapter.

To the left of each line of bytecode you can see the offset of that instruction from wherever `hello` is located in memory. As described earlier in this chapter, eBPF instructions are generally 8 bytes long, and since on a 64-bit platform each memory location can hold 8 bytes, the offset is usually incremented by one for each instruction. However, the first instruction in this program happens to be a wide instruction encoding that requires 16 bytes in order to set Register 6 to a 64-bit value of `0`. That places the instruction in the second line of output at offset `2`. After that there is another 16-byte instruction, setting Register 1 to a 64-bit value of `0`. And after that, the remaining instructions each fit in 8 bytes, so the offset increments by one in each line.

The first byte of each line is the opcode that tells the kernel what operation to perform, and on the right side of each instruction line is the human-readable interpretation of the instruction. At the time of this writing, the Iovisor project has the most complete [documentation](https://oreil.ly/nLbLp) of the eBPF opcodes, but the official [Linux kernel documentation](https://oreil.ly/yp-jW) is catching up, and the eBPF Foundation is working on [standard documentation](https://oreil.ly/7ZWzj) that is not tied to a specific operating system.

For example, let’s take the instruction at offset `5`, which looks like this:

```
    5:   b7 02 00 00 0f 00 00 00 r2 = 15
```

The opcode is `0xb7`, and the documentation tells us the pseudocode corresponding to this is `dst = imm`, which can be read as “Set the destination to the immediate value.” The destination is defined by the second byte, `0x02`, which means “Register 2.” The “immediate” (or literal) value here is `0x0f`, which is 15 in decimal. So we can understand that this instruction tells the kernel to “set Register 2 to value 15.” This corresponds to the output we see on the right side of the instruction: `r2 = 15`.

The instruction at offset `10` is similar:

```
   10:   b7 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 r0 = 2
```

This line also has opcode `0xb7`, and this time it’s setting the value of Register 0 to `2`. When an eBPF program finishes running, Register 0 holds the return code, and `XDP_PASS` has the value `2`. This matches the source code, which always returns `XDP_PASS`.

You now know that *hello.bpf.o* contains an eBPF program in bytecode. The next step is to load it into the kernel.

# Loading the Program into the Kernel

For this example we’ll use a utility called `bpftool`. You can also load programs programmatically, and you’ll see examples of that later in the book.

###### Note

Some Linux distributions provide a package that includes `bpftool`, or you can [compile it from source code](https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool). You can find more details about installing or building this tool on [Quentin Monnet’s blog](https://oreil.ly/Yqepv), as well as additional documentation and usage on the [Cilium site](https://oreil.ly/rnTIg).

The following is an example of using `bpftool` to load a program into the kernel. Note that you’ll likely need to be root (or use `sudo`) to get the BPF privileges that `bpftool` requires.

```
$ bpftool prog load hello.bpf.o /sys/fs/bpf/hello
```

This loads the eBPF program from our compiled object file and “pins” it to the location */sys/fs/bpf/hello*.[4](ch03.html#ch03fn4) No output response to this command indicates success, but you can confirm that the program is in place using `ls`:

```
$ ls /sys/fs/bpf
hello
```

The eBPF program has been successfully loaded. Let’s use the `bpftool` utility to find out more about the program and its status within the kernel.

# Inspecting the Loaded Program

The `bpftool` utility can list all the programs that are loaded into the kernel. If you try this yourself you’ll probably see several preexisting eBPF programs in this output, but for clarity I will just show the lines that relate to our “Hello World” example:

```
$ bpftool prog list 
...
540: xdp  name hello  tag d35b94b4c0c10efb  gpl
        loaded_at 2022-08-02T17:39:47+0000  uid 0
        xlated 96B  jited 148B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 165,166
        btf_id 254
```

The program has been assigned the ID 540. This identity is a number assigned to each program as it’s loaded. Knowing the ID, you can ask `bpftool` to show more information about this program. This time, let’s get the output in prettified JSON format so that the field names are visible, as well as the values:

```
$ bpftool prog show id 540 --pretty
{
    "id": 540,
    "type": "xdp",
    "name": "hello",
    "tag": "d35b94b4c0c10efb",
    "gpl_compatible": true,
    "loaded_at": 1659461987,
    "uid": 0,
    "bytes_xlated": 96,
    "jited": true,
    "bytes_jited": 148,
    "bytes_memlock": 4096,
    "map_ids": [165,166
    ],
    "btf_id": 254
}
```

Given the field names, a lot of this is straightforward to understand:

- The program’s ID is 540.
- The `type` field tells us this program can be attached to a network interface using the XDP event. Several other types of BPF programs can be attached to different sorts of events, and we’ll discuss this more in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ebpf_program_and_attachment_types).
- The name of the program is `hello`, which is the function name from the source code.
- The `tag` is another identifier for this program, which I’ll describe in more detail shortly.
- The program is defined with a GPL-compatible license.
- There’s a timestamp showing when the program was loaded.
- User ID 0 (which is root) loaded the program.
- There are 96 bytes of translated eBPF bytecode in this program, which I’ll show you shortly.
- This program has been JIT-compiled, and the compilation resulted in 148 bytes of machine code. I’ll cover this shortly too.
- The `bytes _memlock` field tells us this program reserves 4,096 bytes of memory that won’t be paged out.
- This program refers to BPF maps with IDs 165 and 166. This might seem surprising, since there is no obvious reference to maps in the source code. You’ll see later in this chapter how map semantics are used to handle global data in eBPF programs.
- You’ll learn about BTF in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#co_recomma_btfcomma_and_libbpf), but for now just know that `btf_id` indicates there is a block of BTF information for this program. This information is included in the object file only if you compile with the `-g` flag.

## The BPF Program Tag

The `tag` is a SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm) sum of the program’s instructions, which can be used as another identifier for the program. The ID can vary every time you load or unload the program, but the tag will remain the same. The `bpftool` utility accepts references to a BPF program by ID, name, tag, or pinned path, so in the example here, all of the following would give the same output:

- `bpftool prog show id 540`
- `bpftool prog show name hello`
- `bpftool prog show tag d35b94b4c0c10efb`
- `bpftool prog show pinned /sys/fs/bpf/hello`

You could have multiple programs with the same name, and even multiple instances of programs with the same tag, but the ID and pinned path will always be unique.

## The Translated Bytecode

The `bytes_xlated` field tells us how many bytes of “translated” eBPF code there are. This is the eBPF bytecode after it has passed through the verifier (and possibly been modified by the kernel for reasons I’ll discuss later in this book).

Let’s use `bpftool` to show this translated version of our “Hello World” code:

```
$ bpftool prog dump xlated name hello 
int hello(struct xdp_md * ctx):
; bpf_printk("Hello World %d", counter);
   0: (18) r6 = map[id:165][0]+0
   2: (61) r3 = *(u32 *)(r6 +0)
   3: (18) r1 = map[id:166][0]+0
   5: (b7) r2 = 15
   6: (85) call bpf_trace_printk#-78032
; counter++; 
   7: (61) r1 = *(u32 *)(r6 +0)
   8: (07) r1 += 1
   9: (63) *(u32 *)(r6 +0) = r1
; return XDP_PASS;
  10: (b7) r0 = 2
  11: (95) exit
```

This looks very similar to the disassembled code you saw earlier in the output from `llvm-objdump`. The offset addresses are the same, and the instructions look similar—for example, we can see the instruction at offset `5` is `r2=15`.

## The JIT-Compiled Machine Code

The translated bytecode is pretty low level, but it’s not quite machine code yet. eBPF uses a JIT compiler to convert eBPF bytecode to machine code that runs natively on the target CPU. The `bytes_jited` field shows that after this conversation the program is 108 bytes long.

###### Note

For higher performance, eBPF programs are generally JIT-compiled. The alternative is to interpret the eBPF bytecode at runtime. The eBPF instruction set and registers were designed to map fairly closely to native machine instructions to make this interpretation straightforward and therefore relatively fast, but compiled programs will be faster, and most architectures now support JIT.[5](ch03.html#ch03fn5)

The `bpftool` utility can generate a dump of this JITed code in assembly language. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with assembly language and this looks entirely incomprehensible! I have included it only to illustrate all the transformations the eBPF code goes through from source code to the executable machine instructions. Here is the command and its output:

```
$ bpftool prog dump jited name hello 
int hello(struct xdp_md * ctx):
bpf_prog_d35b94b4c0c10efb_hello:
; bpf_printk("Hello World %d", counter);

###### Note

Some packaged distributions of `bpftool` don’t yet include support for dumping the JITed output, and if that’s the case, you’ll see “Error: No libbfd support.” You can build `bpftool` for yourself by following the instructions at [*https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool*](https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool).

You’ve seen that the “Hello World” program has been loaded into the kernel, but at this point it’s not yet associated with an event, so nothing will trigger it to run. It needs to be attached to an event.

# Attaching to an Event

The program type has to match the type of event it’s being attached to; you’ll learn more about this in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ebpf_program_and_attachment_types). In this case it’s an XDP program, and you can use `bpftool` to attach the example eBPF program to the XDP event on a network interface, like this:

```
$ bpftool net attach xdp id 540 dev eth0
```

###### Note

At the time of this writing, the `bpftool` utility doesn’t support the ability to attach all program types, but it has [recently been extended](https://oreil.ly/Tt99p) to auto-attach k(ret)probes, u(ret)probes, and tracepoints.

Here I have used the program’s ID of 540, but you can also use the name (provided it is unique) or tag to identify the program being attached. In this example, I have attached the program to the network interface `eth0`.

You can view all the network-attached eBPF programs using `bpftool`:

```
$ bpftool net list 
xdp:
eth0(2) driver id 540

tc:

flow_dissector:
```

The program with ID 540 is attached to the XDP event on the `eth0` interface. This output also gives some clues about some other potential events in the network stack that you can attach eBPF programs to: `tc` and `flow_dissector`. More on this in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ebpf_program_and_attachment_types).

You can also inspect the network interfaces using `ip link`, and you’ll see output that looks something like this (some details have been removed for clarity):

```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT
group default qlen 1000
    ...
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 xdp qdisc fq_codel state UP
mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    ...
    prog/xdp id 540 tag 9d0e949f89f1a82c jited 
    ...
```

In this example there are two interfaces: the loopback interface `lo`, which is used to send traffic to processes on this machine; and the `eth0` interface, which connects this machine to the outside world. This output also shows that `eth0` has a JIT-compiled eBPF program, with identity `540` and tag `9d0e949f89f1a82c`, attached to its XDP hook.

###### Note

You can also use `ip link` to attach and detach XDP programs to a network interface. I have included this as an exercise at the end of this chapter, and there are further examples in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ebpf_program_and_attachment_types).

At this point, the *hello* eBPF program should be producing trace output every time a network packet is received. You can check this out by running `cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe`. This should show a lot of output that looks similar to this:

```
<idle>-0       [003] d.s.. 655370.944105: bpf_trace_printk: Hello World 4531
<idle>-0       [003] d.s.. 655370.944587: bpf_trace_printk: Hello World 4532
<idle>-0       [003] d.s.. 655370.944896: bpf_trace_printk: Hello World 4533
```

If you’re struggling to remember the location of the trace pipe, you can get the same output using the command `bpftool prog tracelog`.

In comparison to the output you saw in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ebpfapostrophes_quotation_markhello_wor), this time there is no command or process ID associated with each of these events; instead, you see `<idle>-0` at the start of each line of trace. In [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ebpfapostrophes_quotation_markhello_wor), each syscall event happened because a process executing a command in user space made a call to the syscall API. That process ID and command are part of the context in which the eBPF program was executed. But in the example here, the XDP event happens due to the arrival of a network packet. There is no user space process associated with this packet—at the point the *hello* eBPF program is triggered, the system hasn’t done anything with the packet other than receive it in memory, and it has no idea what the packet is or where it’s going.

You can see that the counter value that is traced out is being incremented by one each time, as expected. In the source code, `counter` is a global variable. Let’s see how that is implemented in eBPF using a map.

# Global Variables

As you learned in the previous chapter, an eBPF map is a data structure that can be accessed from an eBPF program or from user space. Since the same map can be accessed repeatedly by different runs of the same program, it can be used to hold state from one execution to the next. Multiple programs can also access the same map. Because of these characteristics, map semantics can be repurposed for use as global variables.

###### Note

Before support for [global variables was added in 2019](https://oreil.ly/IDftt), eBPF programmers had to write maps explicitly to perform the same task.

You saw earlier that `bpftool` shows this example program using two maps with the identities 165 and 166. (You will probably see different identities if you try this for yourself, as the identities are assigned when the maps are created in the kernel.) Let’s explore what is in those maps.

The `bpftool` utility can show the maps loaded into the kernel. For clarity I will only show the entries 165 and 166 that relate to the example “Hello World” program:

```
$ bpftool map list
165: array  name hello.bss  flags 0x400
        key 4B  value 4B  max_entries 1  memlock 4096B
        btf_id 254
166: array  name hello.rodata  flags 0x80
        key 4B  value 15B  max_entries 1  memlock 4096B
        btf_id 254  frozen
```

A bss[6](ch03.html#ch03fn6) section in an object file compiled from a C program typically holds global variables, and you can use `bpftool` to inspect its contents, like this:

```
$ bpftool map dump name hello.bss
[{
        "value": {
            ".bss": [{
                    "counter": 11127
                }
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

I could also have used `bpftool map dump id 165` to retrieve the same information. If I run either of these commands again, I’ll see that the counter has increased, as the program has been run every time a network packet is received.

As you’ll learn in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#co_recomma_btfcomma_and_libbpf), `bpftool` is able to pretty-print the field names from a map (here, the variable name `counter`) only if BTF information is available, and that information is included only if you compile with the `-g` flag. If you omitted that flag during the compilation step, you’d see something that looks more like this:

```
$ bpftool map dump name hello.bss
key: 00 00 00 00  value: 19 01 00 00
Found 1 element
```

Without BTF information, `bpftool` has no way of knowing what variable name was used in the source code. You can infer that since there is only one item in this map, the hex value `19 01 00 00` must be the current value of `counter` (281 in decimal, since the bytes are ordered starting with the least significant byte).

You’ve seen here that the eBPF program uses the semantics of a map to read and write to a global variable. Maps are also used to hold static data, as you can see by inspecting the other map.

The fact that the other map is named `hello.rodata` gives a hint that this could be read-only data related to our *hello* program. You can dump the contents of this map to see that it holds the string used by the eBPF program for tracing:

```
$ bpftool map dump name hello.rodata
[{
        "value": {
            ".rodata": [{
                    "hello.____fmt": "Hello World %d"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

If you didn’t compile the object with the `-g` flag, you’ll see output that looks like this:

```
$ bpftool map dump id 166
key: 00 00 00 00  value: 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f  72 6c 64 20 25 64 00
Found 1 element
```

There is one key–value pair in this map, and the value contains 12 bytes of data ending with a 0. It probably won’t surprise you that those bytes are the ASCII representation of the string `"Hello World %d"`.

Now that we’ve finished inspecting this program and its maps, it’s time to clean it up. We’ll start by detaching it from the event that triggers it.

# Detaching the Program

You can detach the program from the network interface like this:

```
$ bpftool net detach xdp dev eth0
```

There is no output if this command runs successfully, but you can confirm that the program is no longer attached by the lack of XDP entries in the output from `bpftool net list`:

```
$ bpftool net list 
xdp:

tc:

flow_dissector:
```

However, the program is still loaded into the kernel:

```
$ bpftool prog show name hello 
395: xdp  name hello  tag 9d0e949f89f1a82c  gpl
        loaded_at 2022-12-19T18:20:32+0000  uid 0
        xlated 48B  jited 108B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 4
```

# Unloading the Program

There’s no inverse of `bpftool prog load` (at least not at the time of this writing), but you can remove the program from the kernel by deleting the pinned pseudofile:

```
$ rm /sys/fs/bpf/hello
$ bpftool prog show name hello
```

There is no output from this `bpftool` command because the program is no longer loaded in the kernel.

# BPF to BPF Calls

In the previous chapter you saw tail calls in action, and I mentioned that now there is also the ability to call functions from within an eBPF program. Let’s take a look at a simple example, which, like the tail call example, can be attached to the `sys_enter` tracepoint, except this time it will trace out the opcode for the syscall. You’ll find the code in *chapter3/hello-func.bpf.c*.

For illustrative purposes I have written a very simple function that extracts the syscall opcode from the tracepoint arguments:

```
static __attribute((noinline)) int get_opcode(struct bpf_raw_tracepoint_args 
                                                                         *ctx) {
   return ctx->args[1];
}
```

Given the choice, the compiler would probably inline this very simple function that I’m only going to call from one place. Since that would defeat the point of this example, I have added `__attribute((noinline))` to force the compiler’s hand. In normal circumstances you should probably omit this and allow the compiler to optimize as it sees fit.

The eBPF function that calls this function looks like this:

```
SEC("raw_tp")
int hello(struct bpf_raw_tracepoint_args *ctx) {
   int opcode = get_opcode(ctx);
   bpf_printk("Syscall: %d", opcode);
   return 0;
}
```

After compiling this to an eBPF object file, you can load it into the kernel and confirm that it is loaded with `bpftool`:

```
$ bpftool prog load hello-func.bpf.o /sys/fs/bpf/hello
$ bpftool prog list name hello 
893: raw_tracepoint  name hello  tag 3d9eb0c23d4ab186  gpl
        loaded_at 2023-01-05T18:57:31+0000  uid 0
        xlated 80B  jited 208B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 204
        btf_id 302
```

The interesting part of this exercise is inspecting the eBPF bytecode to see the `get_opcode()` function:

```
$ bpftool prog dump xlated name hello 
int hello(struct bpf_raw_tracepoint_args * ctx):
; int opcode = get_opcode(ctx);                            
   0: (85) call pc+7#bpf_prog_cbacc90865b1b9a5_get_opcode
; bpf_printk("Syscall: %d", opcode);
   1: (18) r1 = map[id:193][0]+0
   3: (b7) r2 = 12
   4: (bf) r3 = r0
   5: (85) call bpf_trace_printk#-73584
; return 0;
   6: (b7) r0 = 0
   7: (95) exit
int get_opcode(struct bpf_raw_tracepoint_args * ctx):      
; return ctx->args[1];
   8: (79) r0 = *(u64 *)(r1 +8)
; return ctx->args[1];
   9: (95) exit
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

Here you can see the hello() eBPF program making a call to get_opcode(). The eBPF instruction at offset 0 is 0x85, which from the instruction set documentation corresponds to “Function call.” Instead of executing the next instruction, which would be at offset 1, execution will jump seven instructions ahead (pc+7), which means the instruction at offset 8.![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

Here’s the bytecode for get_opcode(), and as you might hope, the first instruction is at offset 8.The function call instruction necessitates putting the current state on the eBPF virtual machine’s stack so that when the called function exits, execution can continue in the calling function. Since the stack size is limited to 512 bytes, BPF to BPF calls can’t be very deeply nested.

###### Note

For a lot more detail on tail calls and BPF to BPF calls, there’s an excellent post by Jakub Sitnicki on Cloudflare’s blog: [“Assembly within! BPF tail calls on x86 and ARM”](https://oreil.ly/6kOp3).

# Summary

In this chapter you saw some example C source code transformed into eBPF bytecode and then compiled to machine code so that it’s ready to be executed in the kernel. You also learned how to use `bpftool` to inspect programs and maps loaded into the kernel, and to attach to XDP events.

In addition, you saw examples of different types of eBPF programs triggered by different kinds of events. An XDP event is triggered by the arrival of a packet of data on a network interface, whereas kprobe and tracepoint events are triggered by hitting some particular point in kernel code. I’ll discuss some other eBPF program types in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ebpf_program_and_attachment_types).

You also learned how maps are used to implement global variables for eBPF programs, and you saw BPF to BPF function calls.

The next chapter goes into another level of detail as I show you what’s happening at the system call level when `bpftool`—or any other user space code—loads programs and attaches them to events.

# Exercises

Here are a few things to try if you want to explore BPF programs further:

1. Try using `ip link` commands like the following to attach and detach the XDP program: $ ip link set dev eth0 xdp obj hello.bpf.o sec xdp $ ip link set dev eth0 xdp off
2. Run any of the BCC examples from [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ebpfapostrophes_quotation_markhello_wor). While the program is running, use a second terminal window to inspect the loaded program using `bpftool`. Here’s an example of what I saw by running the *hello-map.py* example: $ bpftool prog show name hello 197: kprobe name hello tag ba73a317e9480a37 gpl loaded_at 2022-08-22T08:46:22+0000 uid 0 xlated 296B jited 328B memlock 4096B map_ids 65 btf_id 179 pids hello-map.py(2785) You can also use `bpftool prog dump` commands to see the bytecode and machine code versions of those programs.
3. Run *hello-tail.py* from the *chapter2* directory, and while it’s running, take a look at the programs it loaded. You’ll see that each tail call program is listed individually, like this: $ bpftool prog list ... 120: raw_tracepoint name hello tag b6bfd0e76e7f9aac gpl loaded_at 2023-01-05T14:35:32+0000 uid 0 xlated 160B jited 272B memlock 4096B map_ids 29 btf_id 124 pids hello-tail.py(3590) 121: raw_tracepoint name ignore_opcode tag a04f5eef06a7f555 gpl loaded_at 2023-01-05T14:35:32+0000 uid 0 xlated 16B jited 72B memlock 4096B btf_id 124 pids hello-tail.py(3590) 122: raw_tracepoint name hello_exec tag 931f578bd09da154 gpl loaded_at 2023-01-05T14:35:32+0000 uid 0 xlated 112B jited 168B memlock 4096B btf_id 124 pids hello-tail.py(3590) 123: raw_tracepoint name hello_timer tag 6c3378ebb7d3a617 gpl loaded_at 2023-01-05T14:35:32+0000 uid 0 xlated 336B jited 356B memlock 4096B btf_id 124 pids hello-tail.py(3590) You could also use `bpftool prog dump xlated` to look at the bytecode instructions and compare them to what you saw in [“BPF to BPF Calls”](#bpf_to_bpf_calls).
4. *Be careful with this one, as it may be best to simply think about why this happens rather than trying it!* If you return a `0` value from an XDP program, this corresponds to `XDP_ABORTED`, which tells the kernel to abort any further processing of this packet. This might seem a bit counterintuitive given that the `0` value usually indicates success in C, but that’s how it is. So, if you try modifying the program to return `0` and attach it to a virtual machine’s `eth0` interface, all network packets will get dropped. This will be somewhat unfortunate if you’re using SSH to attach to that machine, and you’ll likely have to reboot the machine to regain access! You could run the program within a container so that the XDP program is attached to a virtual Ethernet interface that only affects that container and not the whole virtual machine. There’s an example of doing this at [*https://github.com/lizrice/lb-from-scratch*](https://github.com/lizrice/lb-from-scratch).

[1](ch03.html#ch03fn1-marker) Increasingly, eBPF programs are also being written in Rust, since the Rust compiler supports eBPF bytecode as a target.

[2](ch03.html#ch03fn2-marker) There are a few instructions where the operation is “modified” by the value of other fields in the instruction. For example, there are a set of [atomic instructions](https://oreil.ly/oyTI7) introduced in kernel 5.12 that include an arithmetic operation (`ADD`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`) that is specified in the `imm` field.

[3](ch03.html#ch03fn3-marker) The `-g` flag is required to generate BTF information that you’ll need for CO-RE eBPF programs, which I’ll cover in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#co_recomma_btfcomma_and_libbpf).

[4](ch03.html#ch03fn4-marker) In general, this is optional—eBPF programs can be loaded into the kernel without being pinned to a file location—but it’s not optional for `bpftool`, which always has to pin the programs it loads. The reason for this is covered further in [“BPF Program and Map References”](ch04.html#bpf_program_and_map_references).

[5](ch03.html#ch03fn5-marker) The kernel setting `CONFIG_BPF_JIT` needs to be enabled to take advantage of JIT compilation, and it can be enabled or disabled at runtime with the `net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl` setting. See [the docs](https://oreil.ly/4-xi6) for more information on JIT support on different chip architectures.

[6](ch03.html#ch03fn6-marker) Here, *bss* stands for “block started by symbol.”
