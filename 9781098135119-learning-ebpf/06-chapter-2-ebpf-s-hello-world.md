# Chapter 2. eBPF’s “Hello World”

In the previous chapter I discussed why eBPF is so powerful, but it’s OK if you don’t yet feel you have a concrete grasp of what it really means to run eBPF programs. In this chapter I’ll use a simple “Hello World” example to give you a better feel for it.

As you’ll learn while you read through this book, there are several different libraries and frameworks for writing eBPF applications. As a warm-up, I’ll show you what is probably the most accessible approach from a programming point of view: the [BCC Python framework](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc). This offers a very easy way to write basic eBPF programs. For reasons that I’ll cover in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#co_recomma_btfcomma_and_libbpf), it’s not necessarily an approach I would recommend these days for production apps that you’re intending to distribute to other users, but it’s great for taking your first steps.

###### Note

If you want to try this code for yourself, it is available at [*https://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf*](https://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf) in the *chapter2* directory.

You’ll find the BCC project at [*https://github.com/iovisor/bcc*](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc), and the instructions for installing BCC are at [*https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md*](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

# BCC’s “Hello World”

The following is the full source code of *hello.py*, an eBPF “Hello World” application[1](ch02.html#ch02fn1) written using BCC’s Python library:

```
#!/usr/bin/python  
from bcc import BPF

program = r"""
int hello(void *ctx) {
    bpf_trace_printk("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
"""

b = BPF(text=program)
syscall = b.get_syscall_fnname("execve")
b.attach_kprobe(event=syscall, fn_name="hello")

b.trace_print()
```

This code consists of two parts: the eBPF program itself that will run in the kernel, and some user space code that loads the eBPF program into the kernel and reads out the trace that it generates. As you can see in [Figure 2-1](#the_user_space_and_kernel_components_of), *hello.py* is the user space part of this application, and `hello()` is the eBPF program that runs in the kernel.

![The user space and kernel components of “Hello World”](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/lebp_0201.png)

###### Figure 2-1. The user space and kernel components of “Hello World”

Let’s dig into each line of the source code to understand it better.

The first line tells you this is Python code, and the program that can run it is the Python interpreter (*/usr/bin/python*).

The eBPF program itself is written in C code, and it’s this part:

```
int hello(void *ctx) {
    bpf_trace_printk("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
```

All the eBPF program does is use a helper function, `bpf_trace_printk()`, to write a message. Helper functions are another feature that distinguishes “extended” BPF from its “classic” predecessor. They are a set of functions that eBPF programs can call to interact with the system; I’ll discuss them further in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#co_recomma_btfcomma_and_libbpf). For now you can just think of this as printing a line of text.

The entire eBPF program is defined as a string called `program` in the Python code. This C program needs to be compiled before it can be executed, but BCC takes care of that for you. (You’ll see how to compile eBPF programs yourself in the next chapter.) All you need to do is pass this string as a parameter when creating a BPF object, as in the following line:

```
b = BPF(text=program)
```

eBPF programs need to be attached to an event, and for this example I’ve chosen to attach to the system call `execve`, which is the syscall used to execute a program. Whenever anything or anyone starts a new program executing on this machine, that will call `execve()`, which will trigger the eBPF program. Although the “execve()” name is a standard interface in Linux, the name of the function that implements it in the kernel depends on the chip architecture, but BCC gives us a convenient way to look up the function name for the machine we’re running on:

```
syscall = b.get_syscall_fnname("execve")
```

Now, `syscall` represents the name of the kernel function I’m going to attach to, using a kprobe (you were introduced to the concept of kprobes in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#what_is_ebpf_and_why_is_it_importantque)).[2](ch02.html#ch02fn2) You can attach the `hello` function to that event, like this:

```
b.attach_kprobe(event=syscall, fn_name="hello")
```

At this point, the eBPF program is loaded into the kernel and attached to an event, so the program will be triggered whenever a new executable gets launched on the machine. All that’s left to do in the Python code is to read the tracing that is output by the kernel and write it on the screen:

```
b.trace_print()
```

This `trace_print()` function will loop indefinitely (until you stop the program, perhaps with Ctrl+C), displaying any trace.

[Figure 2-2](#quotation_markhello_worldquotation_mark) illustrates this code. The Python program compiles the C code, loads it into the kernel, and attaches it to the `execve` syscall kprobe. Whenever any application on this (virtual) machine calls `execve()`, it triggers the eBPF `hello()` program, which writes a line of trace into a specific pseudofile. (I’ll cover where that pseudofile is later in this chapter.) The Python program reads the trace message from the pseudofile and displays it to the user.

![“Hello World” in operation](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/lebp_0202.png)

###### Figure 2-2. “Hello World” in operation

# Running “Hello World”

Run this program, and depending on what is happening on the (virtual) machine you’re using, you might see tracing being generated straightaway, because other processes could be executing programs[3](ch02.html#ch02fn3) with the `execve` syscall. If you don’t see anything, open a second terminal and execute any commands you like,[4](ch02.html#ch02fn4) and you’ll see the corresponding trace generated by “Hello World”:

```
$ hello.py
b'     bash-5412    [001] .... 90432.904952: 0: bpf_trace_printk: Hello World'
```

###### Note

Since eBPF is so powerful, it requires special privileges to use it. Privileges are automatically assigned to the root user, so the easiest way to run eBPF programs is as root, perhaps by using `sudo`. For clarity I won’t include `sudo` in the example commands in this book, but if you ever see an “Operation not permitted” error, the first thing to check is whether you’re trying to run eBPF programs as an unprivileged user.

`CAP_BPF` was introduced in kernel version 5.8, and it gives sufficient privilege to perform some eBPF operations like creating certain types of map. However, you will probably need additional capabilities:

- `CAP_PERFMON` and `CAP_BPF` are both required to load tracing programs.
- `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and `CAP_BPF` are both required for loading networking programs.

There is a lot more detail on this in the blog post [“Introduction to CAP_BPF”](https://oreil.ly/G2zFO) by Milan Landaverde.

As soon as the *hello* eBPF program is loaded and attached to an event, it gets triggered by events that are being generated from preexisting processes. This should reinforce a couple of points that you learned in [Chapter 1](ch01.html#what_is_ebpf_and_why_is_it_importantque):

- eBPF programs can be used to dynamically change the behavior of the system. There’s no need to reboot the machine or restart existing processes. eBPF code starts taking effect as soon as it is attached to an event.
- There’s no need to change anything about other applications for them to be visible to eBPF. Wherever you have terminal access on that machine, if you run an executable in it, that will use the `execve()` syscall, and if you have the *hello* program attached to that syscall, it will be triggered to generate tracing output. Likewise, if you have a script that runs executables, that will also trigger the *hello* eBPF program. You don’t need to change anything about the terminal’s shell, the script, or the executables you’re running.

The trace output shows not only the `"Hello World`" string, but also some additional contextual information about the event that triggered the *hello* eBPF program to run. In the example output shown at the beginning of this section, the process that made the `execve` system call had a process ID of 5412, and it was running the command `bash`. For trace messages, this contextual information is added as part of the kernel tracing infrastructure (which isn’t specific to eBPF), but as you’ll see later in this chapter, it’s also possible to retrieve contextual information like this within the eBPF program itself.

You might be wondering how the Python code knows where to read the tracing output from. The answer is not very sophisticated—the `bpf_trace_printk()` helper function in the kernel always sends output to the same predefined pseudofile location: */sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe*. You can confirm this by using `cat` to view its contents; you’ll need root privileges to access it.

A single trace pipe location is fine for a simple “Hello World” example or for basic debugging purposes, but it’s very limited. There is very little flexibility in the format of the output, and it only supports the output of strings, so it’s not terribly useful for passing structured information. Perhaps most importantly, there is just this one location on the (virtual) machine. If you had multiple eBPF programs running simultaneously, they would all write trace output to the same trace pipe, which could get very confusing for a human operator.

There’s a much better way to get information out of an eBPF program: use an eBPF map.

# BPF Maps

A *map* is a data structure that can be accessed from an eBPF program and from user space. Maps are one of the really significant features that distinguish extended BPF from its classic predecessor. (You might think this would mean they are commonly referred to as “eBPF maps,” but you’ll frequently see “BPF maps.” As is generally the case, both terms are used interchangeably.)

Maps can be used to share data among multiple eBPF programs or to communicate between a user space application and eBPF code running in the kernel. Typical uses include the following:

- User space writing configuration information to be retrieved by an eBPF program
- An eBPF program storing state, for later retrieval by another eBPF program (or a future run of the same program)
- An eBPF program writing results or metrics into a map, for retrieval by the user space app that will present results

There are various types of BPF maps defined in Linux’s [*uapi/linux/bpf.h* file](https://oreil.ly/1s1GM), and there is some information about them in the [kernel docs](https://oreil.ly/5oUW7). In general they are all key–value stores, and in this chapter you’ll see examples of maps for hash tables, perf and ring buffers, and arrays of eBPF programs.

Some map types are defined as arrays, which always have a 4-byte index as the key type; other maps are hash tables that can use some arbitrary data type as the key.

There are map types that are optimized for particular types of operations, such as [first-in-first-out queues](https://oreil.ly/VSoEp), [first-in-last-out stacks](https://oreil.ly/VSoEp), [least-recently-used data storage](https://oreil.ly/vpsun), [longest-prefix matching](https://oreil.ly/hZ5aM), and [Bloom filters](https://oreil.ly/DzCTK) (a probabilistic data structure designed to provide very fast results on whether an element exists).

Some eBPF map types hold information about specific types of objects. For example, [sockmaps](https://oreil.ly/UUTHO) and [devmaps](https://oreil.ly/jzKYh) hold information about sockets and network devices and are used by network-related eBPF programs to redirect traffic. A program array map stores a set of indexed eBPF programs, and (as you’ll see later in this chapter) this is used to implement tail calls, where one program can call another. There’s even a [map-of-maps type](https://oreil.ly/038tN) to support storing information about maps.

Some map types have per-CPU variants, which is to say that the kernel uses a different block of memory for each CPU core’s version of that map. This might have you wondering about concurrency concerns for maps that are *not* per-CPU, where multiple CPU cores could be accessing the same map simultaneously. Spin lock support for (some) maps was added in kernel version 5.1, and we’ll return to this subject in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#co_recomma_btfcomma_and_libbpf).

The next example (*chapter2/hello-map.py* in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf)) shows some basic operations using a hash table map. It also demonstrates some of BCC’s convenient abstractions that make it very easy to use maps.

## Hash Table Map

Like the previous example in this chapter, this eBPF program will be attached to a kprobe at the entry to the `execve` system call. It’s going to populate a hash table with key–value pairs, where the key is a user ID and the value is a counter for the number of times `execve` is called by a process running under that user ID. In practice, this example will show how many times each different user has run programs.

First, let’s look at the C code for the eBPF program itself:

```
BPF_HASH(counter_table);                                     

int hello(void *ctx) {
  u64 uid;                                                  
  u64 counter = 0;
  u64 *p;

  uid = bpf_get_current_uid_gid() & 0xFFFFFFFF;              
  p = counter_table.lookup(&uid);                            
  if (p != 0) {                                              
     counter = *p;
  }
  counter++;                                                 
  counter_table.update(&uid, &counter);                      
  return 0;
}
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

BPF_HASH() is a BCC macro that defines a hash table map.![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

bpf_get_current_uid_gid() is a helper function used to obtain the user ID that is running the process that triggered this kprobe event. The user ID is held in the lowest 32 bits of the 64-bit value that gets returned. (The top 32 bits hold the group ID, but that part is masked out.)![3](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/3.png)

Look for an entry in the hash table with a key matching the user ID. It returns a pointer to the corresponding value in the hash table.![4](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/4.png)

If there is an entry for this user ID, set the counter variable to the current value in the hash table (pointed to by p). If there is no entry for this user ID in the hash table, the pointer will be 0, and the counter value will be left at 0. ![5](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/5.png)

Whatever the current counter value is, it gets incremented by one.![6](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/6.png)

Update the hash table with the new counter value for this user ID.Take a closer look at the lines of code that access the hash table:

```
  p = counter_table.lookup(&uid);
```

And later:

```
  counter_table.update(&uid, &counter);
```

If you’re thinking “that’s not proper C code!” you’re absolutely right. C doesn’t support defining methods on structures like that.[5](ch02.html#ch02fn5) This is a great example where BCC’s version of C is very loosely a C-like language that BCC rewrites before it sends the code to the compiler. BCC offers some convenient shortcuts and macros that it converts into “proper” C.

Just like in the previous example, the C code is defined as a string called `program`. The program is compiled, loaded into the kernel, and attached to the `execve` kprobe, in exactly the same way as the previous “Hello World” example:

```
b = BPF(text=program)
syscall = b.get_syscall_fnname("execve")
b.attach_kprobe(event=syscall, fn_name="hello")
```

This time a little more work is required on the Python side to read the information out of the hash table:

```
while True:                                       
  sleep(2)                                         
  s = ""
  for k,v in b["counter_table"].items():          
    s += f"ID {k.value}: {v.value}\t"
  print(s)
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

This part of the code loops indefinitely, looking for output to display every two seconds.![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

BCC automatically creates a Python object to represent the hash table. This code loops through any values and prints them to the screen.When you run this example, you’ll want a second terminal window where you can run some commands. Here’s some example output I obtained, annotated on the right side with the commands I ran in another terminal:

```
Terminal 1                          Terminal 2
$ ./hello-map.py 
                                    [blank line(s) until I run something]
ID 501: 1                           ls 
ID 501: 1
ID 501: 2                           ls
ID 501: 3       ID 0: 1             sudo ls
ID 501: 4       ID 0: 1             ls
ID 501: 4       ID 0: 1
ID 501: 5       ID 0: 2             sudo ls
```

This example generates a line of output every two seconds, whether anything has happened or not. At the end of this output, the hash table contains two entries:

- `key=501, value=5`
- `key=0, value=2`

In the second terminal, I have the user ID of 501. Running the `ls` command with this user ID increments the `execve` counter. When I run `sudo ls`, this results in two calls to `execve`: one is the execution of `sudo`, under user ID 501; the other is the execution of `ls`, under root’s user ID of 0.

In this example, I used a hash table to convey data from the eBPF program to user space. (I could also have used an array type of map here, since the key was an integer; hash tables let you use an arbitrary type as the key.) Hash tables are very convenient when the data is naturally in key–value pairs, but the user space code has to keep polling the table on a regular basis. The Linux kernel already supported the [perf subsystem](https://oreil.ly/nTvvH) for sending data from the kernel to user space, and eBPF includes support for using perf buffers and their successor, BPF ring buffers. Let’s take a look.

## Perf and Ring Buffer Maps

In this section I’m going to describe a slightly more sophisticated version of “Hello World” that uses BCC’s `BPF_PERF_OUTPUT` capabilities, which let you write data in a structure of your choosing into a perf ring buffer map.

###### Note

There is a newer construct called “BPF ring buffers” that are now generally preferred over BPF perf buffers, if you have a kernel of version 5.8 or above. Andrii Nakryiko discusses the difference in his [BPF ring buffer](https://oreil.ly/ARRyV) blog post. You’ll see an example of BCC’s `BPF_RINGBUF_OUTPUT` in [Chapter 4](ch04.html#the_bpfleft_parenthesisright_parenthesi).

# Ring Buffers

Ring buffers are by no means unique to eBPF, but I’ll explain them just in case you haven’t come across them before. You can think of a ring buffer as a piece of memory logically organized in a ring, with separate “write” and “read” pointers. Data of some arbitrary length gets written to wherever the write pointer is, with the length information included in a header for that data. The write pointer moves to after the end of that data, ready for the next write operation.

Similarly, for a read operation, data gets read from wherever the read pointer is, using the header to determine how much data to read. The read pointer moves along in the same direction as the write pointer so that it points to the next available piece of data. This is illustrated in [Figure 2-3](#a_ring_buffer), showing a ring buffer with three items of different length available for reading.

If the read pointer catches up with the write pointer, it simply means there’s no data to read. If a write operation would make the write pointer overtake the read pointer, the data doesn’t get written and a *drop counter* gets incremented. Read operations include the drop counter to indicate whether data has been lost since the last successful read.

If read and write operations happened at precisely the same rate with no variability, and they always contained the same amount of data, you could at least in theory get away with a ring buffer just big enough to accommodate that data size. In most applications there will be some variation in the time between reads, writes, or both, so the buffer size needs to be tuned to account for this.

![A ring buffer](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/lebp_0203.png)

###### Figure 2-3. A ring buffer

You’ll find the source code for this example in *chapter2/hello-buffer.py* in the *Learning eBPF* [GitHub repository](http://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf). As in the first “Hello World” example you saw early in this chapter, this version will write the string `"Hello World"` to the screen every time the `execve()` syscall is used. It will also look up the process ID and the name of the command that makes each `execve()` call so that you’ll get similar output to the first example. This gives me the opportunity to show you a couple more examples of BPF helper functions.

Here’s the eBPF program that will be loaded into the kernel:

```
BPF_PERF_OUTPUT(output);                                                

struct data_t {                                                         
   int pid;
   int uid;
   char command[16];
   char message[12];
};

int hello(void *ctx) {
   struct data_t data = {};                                             
   char message[12] = "Hello World";

   data.pid = bpf_get_current_pid_tgid() >> 32;                         
   data.uid = bpf_get_current_uid_gid() & 0xFFFFFFFF;                   

   bpf_get_current_comm(&data.command, sizeof(data.command));            
   bpf_probe_read_kernel(&data.message, sizeof(data.message), message); 

   output.perf_submit(ctx, &data, sizeof(data));                        

   return 0;
}
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

BCC defines the macro BPF_PERF_OUTPUT for creating a map that will be used to pass messages from the kernel to user space. I’ve called this map output.![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

Every time hello() is run, the code will write a structure’s worth of data. This is the definition of that structure, which has fields for the process ID, the name of the currently running command, and a text message.![3](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/3.png)

data is a local variable that holds the data structure to be submitted, and message holds the "Hello World" string. ![4](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/4.png)

bpf_get_current_pid_tgid() is a helper function that gets the ID of the process that triggered this eBPF program to run. It returns a 64-bit value with the process ID in the top 32 bits.6![5](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/5.png)

bpf_get_current_uid_gid() is the helper function you saw in the previous example for obtaining the user ID.![6](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/6.png)

Similarly, bpf_get_current_comm() is a helper function for getting the name of the executable (or “command”) that’s running in the process that made the execve syscall. This is a string, not a numeric value like the process and user IDs, and in C you can’t simply assign a string using =. You have to pass the address of the field where the string should be written, &data.command, as an argument to the helper function.![7](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/7.png)

For this example, the message is "Hello World" every time. bpf_probe_read_kernel() copies it into the right place in the data structure. ![8](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/8.png)

At this point the data structure is populated with the process ID, command name, and message. This call to output.perf_submit() puts that data into the map.Just as in the first “Hello World” example, this C program is assigned to a string called `program` in the Python code. What follows is the rest of the Python code:

```
b = BPF(text=program)                                
syscall = b.get_syscall_fnname("execve")
b.attach_kprobe(event=syscall, fn_name="hello")

def print_event(cpu, data, size):                    
   data = b["output"].event(data)
   print(f"{data.pid} {data.uid} {data.command.decode()} " + \
         f"{data.message.decode()}")

b["output"].open_perf_buffer(print_event)            
while True:                                          
   b.perf_buffer_poll()
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

The lines that compile the C code, load it into the kernel, and attach it to the syscall event are unchanged from the version of “Hello World” you saw earlier.![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

print_event is a callback function that will output a line of data to the screen. BCC does some heavy lifting so that I can refer to the map simply as b["output"] and grab data from it using b["output"].event().![3](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/3.png)

b["output"].open_perf_buffer() opens the perf ring buffer. The function takes print_event as an argument to define that this is the callback function to be used whenever there is data to read from the buffer. ![4](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/4.png)

The program will now loop indefinitely,7 polling the perf ring buffer. If there is any data available, print_event will get called.Running this code gives us output that’s fairly similar to the original “Hello World”:

```
$ sudo ./hello-buffer.py
11654 node Hello World
11655 sh Hello World
...
```

As before, you might need to open a second terminal to the same (virtual) machine and run some commands to trigger some output.

The big difference between this and the original “Hello World” example is that instead of using a single, central trace pipe, the data is now being passed via a ring buffer map called `output` that was created by this program for its own use, as shown in [Figure 2-4](#using_a_perf_ring_buffer_for_passing_da).

![Using a perf ring buffer for passing data from the kernel to user space](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/lebp_0204.png)

###### Figure 2-4. Using a perf ring buffer for passing data from the kernel to user space

You can verify that the information isn’t going to the trace pipe by using `cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe`.

As well as demonstrating the use of a ring buffer map, this example shows some eBPF helper functions for retrieving contextual information about the event that triggered the eBPF program to run. Here you’ve seen helper functions getting the user ID, the process ID, and the name of the current command. As you’ll see in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ebpf_program_and_attachment_types), the set of contextual information that’s available and the set of valid helper functions that can be used to retrieve it depend on what type of program it is and what event triggered it.

The fact that contextual information like this is available to the eBPF code is what makes it so valuable for observability. Whenever an event occurs, an eBPF program can report not only the fact that the event happened but also relevant information about what happened to trigger the event. It’s also highly performant, since all this information can be gathered within the kernel, without the need for any synchronous context switching to user space.

You’ll see further examples in this book where eBPF helper functions are used to gather other contextual data, as well as examples where eBPF programs change the contextual data or even block events from happening altogether.

## Function Calls

You’ve seen that eBPF programs can call helper functions provided by the kernel, but what if you want to split the code you’re writing into functions? Generally, in software development it’s considered good practice[8](ch02.html#ch02fn8) to pull common code into a function that you can call from multiple places, rather than duplicating the same lines over and over again. But in the early days, eBPF programs were not permitted to call functions other than helper functions. To work around this, programmers have directed the compiler to “always inline” their functions, like this:

```
static __always_inline void my_function(void *ctx, int val)
```

Generally, a function in source code results in the compiler emitting a jump instruction, which causes execution to jump to the set of instructions that make up the called function (and then to jump back again when that function has completed). You can see this illustrated on the left side of [Figure 2-5](#layout_of_noninlined_and_inlined_functi). The right side shows what happens when a function is inlined: there is no jump instruction; instead, a copy of the function’s instructions is emitted directly within the calling function.

![Layout of noninlined and inlined function instructions](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/lebp_0205.png)

###### Figure 2-5. Layout of noninlined and inlined function instructions

If the function is called from multiple places, that results in multiple copies of that function’s instructions in the compiled executable. (Sometimes the compiler might choose to inline a function for optimization purposes, and that is one reason why you might not be able to attach a kprobe to certain kernel functions. I’ll come back to this in [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ebpf_program_and_attachment_types).)

Starting from Linux kernel 4.16 and LLVM 6.0, the restriction requiring functions to be inlined was lifted so that eBPF programmers could write function calls more naturally. However, this feature, called “BPF to BPF function calls” or “BPF subprograms,” isn’t currently supported by the BCC framework, so let’s come back to it in the next chapter. (You can, of course, continue to use functions with BCC if they are inlined.)

There is another mechanism for decomposing complex functionality into smaller parts in eBPF: tail calls.

## Tail Calls

As described at [ebpf.io](https://oreil.ly/Loyuz), “tail calls can call and execute another eBPF program and replace the execution context, similar to how the `execve()` system call operates for regular processes.” In other words, execution doesn’t return to the caller after a tail call completes.

###### Note

[Tail calls](https://oreil.ly/cOA1r) are by no means exclusive to eBPF programming. The general motivation behind tail calls is to avoid adding frames to the stack over and over again as a function is called recursively, which can eventually lead to stack overflow errors. If you can arrange your code to call a recursive function as the last thing it does, the stack frame associated with the calling function isn’t really doing anything useful. Tail calls allow for calling a series of functions without growing the stack. This is particularly useful in eBPF where the [stack is limited to 512 bytes](https://oreil.ly/SZmkd).

Tail calls are made using the `bpf_tail_call()` helper function, which has the following signature:

```
long bpf_tail_call(void *ctx, struct bpf_map *prog_array_map, u32 index)
```

The three arguments to this function have the following meanings:

- `ctx` allows passing the context from the calling eBPF program to the callee.
- `prog_array_map` is an eBPF map of type `BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY`, which holds a set of file descriptors that identify eBPF programs.
- `index` indicates which of that set of eBPF programs should be invoked.

This helper is somewhat unusual in that if it succeeds, it never returns. The currently running eBPF program is replaced on the stack by the program being called. The helper could fail, for example, if the indicated program doesn’t exist in the map, in which case the calling program carries on executing.

User space code has to load all the eBPF programs into the kernel (as usual), and it also sets up the program array map.

Let’s look at a simple example written in Python using BCC; you’ll find the code in the [GitHub repo](http://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf) as *chapter2/hello-tail.py*. The main eBPF program is attached to a tracepoint at the common entry point for all syscalls. This program uses tail calls to trace out specific messages for certain syscall opcodes. If there isn’t a tail call for a given opcode, the program traces out a generic message.

If you’re using the BCC framework, to make a [tail call](https://oreil.ly/rT9e1) you can use a line of the slightly simpler form:

```
prog_array_map.call(ctx, index)
```

Before passing the code to the compilation step, BCC will rewrite the preceding line to this:

```
bpf_tail_call(ctx, prog_array_map, index)
```

Here is the source code for the eBPF program and its tail calls:

```
BPF_PROG_ARRAY(syscall, 300);                                   

int hello(struct bpf_raw_tracepoint_args *ctx) {                
   int opcode = ctx->args[1];                                   
   syscall.call(ctx, opcode);                                   
   bpf_trace_printk("Another syscall: %d", opcode);             
   return 0;
}

int hello_execve(void *ctx) {                                   
   bpf_trace_printk("Executing a program");
   return 0;
}

int hello_timer(struct bpf_raw_tracepoint_args *ctx) {          
   if (ctx->args[1] == 222) {
       bpf_trace_printk("Creating a timer");
   } else if (ctx->args[1] == 226) {
       bpf_trace_printk("Deleting a timer");
   } else {
       bpf_trace_printk("Some other timer operation");
   }
   return 0;
}

int ignore_opcode(void *ctx) {                                  
   return 0;
}
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

BCC provides a BPF_PROG_ARRAY macro for easily defining maps of type BPF_MAP_TYPE_PROG_ARRAY. I have called the map syscall and allowed for 300 entries,9 which is going to be sufficient for this example. ![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

In the user space code that you’ll see shortly, I’m going to attach this eBPF program to the sys_enter raw tracepoint, which gets hit whenever any syscall is made. The context passed to an eBPF program attached to a raw tracepoint takes the form of this bpf_raw_tracepoint_args structure. ![3](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/3.png)

In the case of sys_enter, the raw tracepoint arguments include the opcode identifying which syscall is being made.![4](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/4.png)

Here we make a tail call to the entry in the program array whose key matches the opcode. This line of code will be rewritten by BCC to a call to the bpf_tail_call() helper function before it passes the source code to the compiler.![5](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/5.png)

If the tail call succeeds, this line tracing out the opcode value will never be hit. I’ve used this to provide a default line of trace for opcodes for which there isn’t a program entry in the map. ![6](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/6.png)

hello_exec() is a program that will be loaded into the syscall program array map, to be executed as a tail call when the opcode indicates it’s an execve() syscall. It’s just going to generate a line of trace to tell the user a new program is being executed.![7](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/7.png)

hello_timer() is another program that will be loaded into the syscall program array. In this case it’s going to be referred to by more than one entry in the program array.![8](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/8.png)

ignore_opcode() is a tail call program that does nothing. I’ll use this for syscalls where I don’t want any trace to be generated at all.Now let’s look at the user space code that loads and manages this set of eBPF programs:

```
b = BPF(text=program)                                              
b.attach_raw_tracepoint(tp="sys_enter", fn_name="hello")           

ignore_fn = b.load_func("ignore_opcode", BPF.RAW_TRACEPOINT)       
exec_fn = b.load_func("hello_exec", BPF.RAW_TRACEPOINT)
timer_fn = b.load_func("hello_timer", BPF.RAW_TRACEPOINT)

prog_array = b.get_table("syscall")                                
prog_array[ct.c_int(59)] = ct.c_int(exec_fn.fd)
prog_array[ct.c_int(222)] = ct.c_int(timer_fn.fd)
prog_array[ct.c_int(223)] = ct.c_int(timer_fn.fd)
prog_array[ct.c_int(224)] = ct.c_int(timer_fn.fd)
prog_array[ct.c_int(225)] = ct.c_int(timer_fn.fd)
prog_array[ct.c_int(226)] = ct.c_int(timer_fn.fd)

# Ignore some syscalls that come up a lot                          
prog_array[ct.c_int(21)] = ct.c_int(ignore_fn.fd)
prog_array[ct.c_int(22)] = ct.c_int(ignore_fn.fd)
prog_array[ct.c_int(25)] = ct.c_int(ignore_fn.fd)
...

b.trace_print()                                                    
```

![1](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/1.png)

Instead of attaching to a kprobe, as you saw earlier, this time the user space code attaches the main eBPF program to the sys_enter tracepoint.![2](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/2.png)

These calls to b.load_func() return a file descriptor for each tail call program. Notice that tail calls need to have the same program type as their parent—BPF.RAW_TRACEPOINT in this case. Also, it bears pointing out that each tail call program is an eBPF program in its own right.![3](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/3.png)

The user space code creates entries in the syscall map. The map doesn’t have to be fully populated for every possible opcode; if there is no entry for a particular opcode, it simply means no tail call will be executed. Also, it’s perfectly fine to have multiple entries that point to the same eBPF program. In this case, I want the hello_timer() tail call to be executed for any of a set of timer-related syscalls.![4](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/4.png)

Some syscalls get run so frequently by the system that a line of trace for each of them clutters up the trace output to the point of unreadability. I’ve used the ignore_opcode() tail call for several syscalls.![5](/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098135119/files/assets/5.png)

Print the trace output to the screen, until the user terminates the program.Running this program generates trace output for every syscall that runs on the (virtual) machine, unless the opcode has an entry that links it to the `ignore_opcode()` tail call. Here’s some example output from running `ls` in another terminal (some details have been omitted for readability):

```
./hello-tail.py 
b'   hello-tail.py-2767    ... Another syscall: 62'
b'   hello-tail.py-2767    ... Another syscall: 62'
...
b'            bash-2626    ... Executing a program'
b'            bash-2626    ... Another syscall: 220'
...
b'           <...>-2774    ... Creating a timer'
b'           <...>-2774    ... Another syscall: 48'
b'           <...>-2774    ... Deleting a timer'
...
b'              ls-2774    ... Another syscall: 61'
b'              ls-2774    ... Another syscall: 61'
...
```

The particular syscalls being executed are beside the point, but you can see that the different tail calls are getting called and are generating trace messages. You can also see the default message `Another syscall` for opcodes that don’t have an entry in the tail call program map.

###### Note

Check out Paul Chaignon’s blog post about the [cost of BPF tail calls](https://oreil.ly/jTxcb) on various different kernel versions.

Tail calls have been supported in eBPF since kernel version 4.2, but for a long time they were incompatible with making BPF to BPF function calls. This restriction was lifted in kernel 5.10.[10](ch02.html#ch02fn10)

The fact that you can chain up to 33 tail calls together, combined with the instruction complexity limit per eBPF program of 1 million instructions, means that today’s eBPF programmers have a lot of leeway to write very complex code to run entirely in the kernel.

# Summary

I hope that by showing some concrete examples of an eBPF program, this chapter helped you consolidate your mental model of eBPF code running in the kernel, triggered by events. You’ve also seen examples of data being passed from the kernel to user space using BPF maps.

Using the BCC framework hides many of the details of how the program is built, loaded into the kernel, and attached to events. In the next chapter I’ll show you a different approach to writing “Hello World,” and we’ll dive deeper into those hidden details.

# Exercises

Here are some optional activities you might like to try (or think about) if you want to explore “Hello World” a bit further:

1. Adapt the *hello-buffer.py* eBPF program to output different trace messages for odd and even process IDs.
2. Modify *hello-map.py* so that the eBPF code gets triggered by more than one syscall. For example, `openat()` is commonly called to open files, and `write()` is called to write data to a file. You can start by attaching the *hello* eBPF program to multiple syscall kprobes. Then try having modified versions of the *hello* eBPF program for different syscalls, demonstrating that you can access the same map from multiple different programs.
3. The *hello-tail.py* eBPF program is an example of a program that attaches to the `sys_enter` raw tracepoint that is hit whenever *any* syscall is called. Change *hello-map.py* to show the total number of syscalls made by each user ID, by attaching it to that same `sys_enter` raw tracepoint. Here’s some example output I got after making that change: $ ./hello-map.py ID 104: 6 ID 0: 225 ID 104: 6 ID 101: 34 ID 100: 45 ID 0: 332 ID 501: 19 ID 104: 6 ID 101: 34 ID 100: 45 ID 0: 368 ID 501: 38 ID 104: 6 ID 101: 34 ID 100: 45 ID 0: 533 ID 501: 57
4. The [`RAW_TRACEPOINT_PROBE` macro provided by BCC](https://oreil.ly/kh-j4) simplifies attaching to raw tracepoints, telling the user space BCC code to automatically attach it to a specified tracepoint. Try it in *hello-tail.py*, like this: You should see that BCC automatically creates the attachment and the program works exactly the same. This is an example of the many convenient macros that BCC provides.
  - Replace the definition of the `hello()` function with `RAW_TRACEPOINT_PROBE(sys_enter)`.
  - Remove the explicit attachment call `b.attach_raw_tracepoint()` from the Python code.
5. You could further adapt *hello_map.py* so that the key in the hash table identifies a particular syscall (rather than a particular user). The output will show how many times that syscall has been called across the whole system.

[1](ch02.html#ch02fn1-marker) I originally wrote this for a talk titled “The Beginner’s Guide to eBPF Programming.” You can find the original code along with links to the slides and video at [*https://github.com/lizrice/ebpf-beginners*](https://github.com/lizrice/ebpf-beginners).

[2](ch02.html#ch02fn2-marker) There is a more performant way to attach eBPF programs to functions, available from kernel version 5.5 onward, that uses fentry (and the corresponding fexit instead of kretprobe for the exit from a function). I’ll discuss this later in the book, but for now I’m using kprobe to keep the example in this chapter as simple as possible.

[3](ch02.html#ch02fn3-marker) I quite often use VScode remote to connect to a virtual machine in the cloud. This runs lots of node scripts on the virtual machine, which generates lots of tracing from this “Hello World” app.

[4](ch02.html#ch02fn4-marker) Some commands (`echo` is a common example) might be shell built-ins that run as part of the shell process, rather than executing a new program. These won’t trigger the `execve()` event, so no trace will be generated.

[5](ch02.html#ch02fn5-marker) C++ does, but not C.

[6](ch02.html#ch02fn6-marker) The lower 32 bits are the *thread group ID*. For a single-threaded process, this is the same as the process ID, but additional threads for the process would be given different IDs. The docs for the GNU C library have a good description of the difference between [process and thread group IDs](https://oreil.ly/Wo9k3).

[7](ch02.html#ch02fn7-marker) This is just example code, so I’m not worrying about cleaning up on keyboard interrupt or any other niceties!

[8](ch02.html#ch02fn8-marker) This principle is often called “DRY” (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”), as popularized by [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://oreil.ly/QFich).

[9](ch02.html#ch02fn9-marker) There are some 300 syscalls in Linux, and since I’m not using any recently added syscalls for this example, this is good enough.

[10](ch02.html#ch02fn10-marker) Making tail calls from a BPF subprogram requires support from the JIT compiler, which you’ll meet in the next chapter. In the kernel version I used to write the examples in this book, only the JIT compiler on x86 has this support, although [support has been added to ARM in kernel 6.0](https://oreil.ly/KYUYS).
